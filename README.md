# PaxEngine3
PaxEngine3 is a game engine centered about designing and extensible, transparent, and intuitive API.
Finding easy but sufficiently expressive ways for creating your game is the central idea.
It does not provide sophisticated graphics but allows to integrate those at any time.

GameEntities and Worlds are implemented as entities of the custom entity-component system [Polypropylene](https://github.com/PaulAtTUBS/Polypropylene).
This allows defining and changing worlds and game objects arbitrarily, flexibly, and serializable.
